# simple-jails

See:

- `thinjail.sh` for the thin jail script
- `clonejail.sh` for the clone jail script
- `vagrant/` for an example of how to use them


## What this is for

This *is* for FreeBSD users who want to learn how to create thin jails and want the simplest
possible ready-to-use script to play around with. It's annotated and meant to be modified. It's for
those who want to know exactly what's going on with their system and how it's set up.

This *is not* for users that are looking for a fully mature solution that does everything and
simplifies a bunch of work. There are already libraries that do this well, such as [ezjail][1] and
[iocage][2].
